- I researched and collected the heart disease classification dataset from Kaggle and other open source websites. 
- I applied filters such as classification, size, file format, and license to obtain a suitable dataset for our project. 
- The dataset initially had 13 columns, but I researched and identified the 8 best features relevant to heart disease.
- I uploaded the final dataset to the Google Cloud Storage bucket and created a dataset in GCP.
